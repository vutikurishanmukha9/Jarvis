"""Rubric middleware for self-evaluated agent iteration.

`RubricMiddleware` lets a caller declare *what done looks like* via a
rubric. Each time the agent would otherwise finish — i.e. the model
returns a response with no further tool calls — the middleware invokes a
separate grader sub-agent against the transcript. If the grader returns
`needs_revision`, its feedback is injected as a `HumanMessage` and the
agent loop resumes. Grading repeats until the grader returns `satisfied`

    unconditionally in a `create_deep_agent` stack.

    !!! note "Observing non-satisfied terminations"

        When grading ends with `failed`, `max_iterations_reached`, or
        `grader_error`, the middleware does **not** mutate the response
        messages. The last `AIMessage` in the agent's output is whatever
        the model produced just before the grader gave up. Callers who
        need to branch on non-satisfied termination must inspect one of:

        - `_rubric_status` on the returned state (or `agent.get_state(...)`
            on a checkpointed thread),
        - the `on_evaluation` callback,
        - the `rubric_evaluation_end` stream event.

        An info log is also emitted when `max_iterations_reached` fires.

    Args:
        model: Model used by the grader sub-agent.

            Accepts either a model string like `"provider:model-id"` or
            a `BaseChatModel` instance.
        system_prompt: Custom grading instructions; falls back to the
            built-in grader prompt when not set.
        tools: Tools the grader may call before producing its
            `GraderResponse`.

            With none, the grader reasons from the transcript alone.
        max_iterations: Maximum grader iterations per rubric attempt; must be a
            positive integer.

            When the cap is reached without a `satisfied` verdict, the agent
            terminates with status `'max_iterations_reached'` (see the
            note above on how to observe this).
        on_evaluation: Optional callback one can invoke with each `RubricEvaluation` after
            grading.

            Exceptions raised by the callback are logged at error level and
